b*****9,3,sad at the quality of larimar beads but since it’s on sale so can’t complain much too. Would cost $40 to replace it to a better quality ones~ so end up it will be over $100. Not worth. Very competitive to claim over live sale. Can only blame self for claim without looking. Can’t blame seller.

nycrisa,5,Another lovely buy from JS x Lavval. Last one of Shoppee as they decided to ban my account when I refused to give in to an unreasonable need for my IC to be submitted to appeal against my account being limited for activities against their policies. Sounds like a scam. 😂
