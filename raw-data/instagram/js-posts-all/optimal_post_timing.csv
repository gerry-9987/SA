Hi friends! I’m Jam and I started Jamstones during my university term break in 2020. We were in the midst of the circuit breaker  and I decided to spread some sparks and joy using natural crystals with a modern twist. As a homegrown business,  I had to do all the planning, from designing the bracelets, planning the marketing to packing the orders. All this while, I was also pursuing my full time degree and internships.  Through Jamstones, I learnt to manage my time, embrace changes and uncertainties. It has been a roller coaster ride in the past year :) with covid19, the e-commerce sector has been changing drastically. Honestly, there were some days when I felt like giving up, probably from the burnt out in my personal life, studies, internships and Jamstones. But  I always push myself to find a balance and with the support from my loved ones I was able to find it🤣 (still a work in progress 😛) 

Fast forward to 2021, Jamstones have grown to a small business with a wonderful team. I am truly thankful for all the love and support from my customers and friends. Looking back, I can’t believe how much we have accomplished together in the past 1.5 years 🥺

Milestones
April 2020 - Sold my first crystal bracelet 💗
July 2020 - Launched Jamstones.sg with the help of my boyfriend 🥰 
Sep 2020 - Joined the plant a tree campaign with @newagefsg @lavvalsg 🌳 
Jan 2021 - Together with @newagefsg @lavvalsg ,Jamstones moved to a bigger office space 
April 2021 - Turned 1 and together with @newagefsg and @newagegaia, launched the Crystal Beading Workshop at NA-Gaia studio. 
Sep 2021 - Graduated from University 🎓 

Moving forward to the next phase of my life, I am not sure what to expect 🤣 just excited for what is coming into my life. For 2022, one of my goals is to continue to spread joy through crystals by working with social organizations and doing my part for the community. 

Last but not least, I am thankful to all the wonderful people around me who have supported me and Jamstones unconditionally. I hope my crystals will always bring you as much joy as it has to me. Cheers to a wonderful 2022 !!",81,818

Apart from spreading joy and love through crystals. It has always been my dream to raise awareness and be part of a good cause! My mother has always inspired me to pay forward as much as I am able too.  She always believed that everyone can make a difference and every action counts!🙆🏻‍♀️💪🏻✨

For every purchase you make with @newagefsg @lavvalbynewagefsg @crystalbynewagefsg  we will contribute $1 to our Grow Green Campaign 🌳. This tree-planting drive will see us planting trees in India 🇮🇳 and supporting rural farmers at the same time👨‍🌾 👩‍🌾.

Trees play a vital role in our lives, providing clean air, cooling down the earth and providing habitats for creatures great and small. Together, we hope to make a positive difference in the environment and to increase the green on Mother Earth.

Many of my best memories were made by the seaside and I hope to express them through the 9 bracelets that I’ll be launching tonight. The crystals that I have personally handpicked in this collection have properties that resonate with the sea. They represent clarity, solace and beauty.
