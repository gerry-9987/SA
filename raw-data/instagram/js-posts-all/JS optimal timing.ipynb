      "Hi friends! I’m Jam and I started Jamstones during my university term break in 2020. We were in the midst of the circuit breaker  and I decided to spread some sparks and joy using natural crystals with a modern twist. As a homegrown business,  I had to do all the planning, from designing the bracelets, planning the marketing to packing the orders. All this while, I was also pursuing my full time degree and internships.  Through Jamstones, I learnt to manage my time, embrace changes and uncertainties. It has been a roller coaster ride in the past year :) with covid19, the e-commerce sector has been changing drastically. Honestly, there were some days when I felt like giving up, probably from the burnt out in my personal life, studies, internships and Jamstones. But  I always push myself to find a balance and with the support from my loved ones I was able to find it🤣 (still a work in progress 😛) \n",
