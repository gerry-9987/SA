A big warm hug to all who came by and participated in our confessional + lucky draw (ILLA NOCTE’S DARKEST SECRETS) 🥺 There is strength and bravery in being vulnerable - give yourself a little love for daring to bare your soul and showing up for yourselves 💪🏼

A VALENTINE’S DAY POP UP BY ILLA NOCTE✨

Since day 1 (we’ve been here for a long time 😹), I’ve always envisioned ILLA NOCTE to be more than just a crystal store. While the past few years have been our proudest journey filled with love, hard work, tears, joy, AND a lot of crystals, I do think that there is a lot more room for growth and steering it into the direction we’ve imagined from the start.

“Not just a crystal store” can mean many things but one core value we have, is to constantly put all of your experiences FIRST and to ONLY release products that we’re 100% satisfied with. 

With that said, I’m happy to introduce our latest confessional + lucky draw box concept - ILLA NOCTE’S DARKEST SECRETS. We will be featuring this for the first time at our pop up! Every $30 purchase gets you an entry to write down all your deepest, darkest secrets and confessions. This time, to a stranger or a lover with the prompt of: ALL THE THINGS I SHOULD HAVE SAID BUT DIDN’T. 

There will be lucky draw prizes for selected entries! This draw will be announced on our IG live stream💘
 
I hope you’ll come by to experience all that we have prepared for you, and to bare your soul with us🌹

See you on the other side!

A VALENTINE’S DAY POP UP BY ILLA NOCTE✨

What was meant to be our first pop up of 2022 turns out to be a full blown concept and lots of running ideas 🥵 Frankly, as much as it may seem like we’re overdoing it…I’m feeling so inspired to make some noise 🔥

This Valentine’s Day pop up theme was to pay homage to my own experiences and I believe, the experience of many others. Transitioning from strangers to lovers, or lovers to strangers and everything in between does evoke a myriad of complex emotions and experiences. There isn’t any wrong or right way to go about them. It certainly isn’t easy but I find comfort in knowing that we can exist in grey areas. 

I hope whoever is reading this can find comfort in the grey areas too. This pop up theme is for everyone who have been a stranger, a lover, loved a stranger, a lover, or are still loving and anything in between 💘

Also, it blows my mind that the intersection of the Venn diagram looks exactly like the 👁 design on our freshly painted manicure 💅🤯

Buddha represents peace and tranquility in a home, while the head of Buddha symbolises wisdom and knowledge. Recommended spots to place a Buddha statue (or any statue of deity) are places of reverence. You may have them on your altars, at heights of at least eye level, and in restful, uncluttered spaces. Avoid bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchens, store rooms and laundry rooms.

51,51,2021-07-26 15:12:11,"This post sat in my drafts for 2 days. I don’t particularly like being in the limelight and found myself working better in the shadows. I also recently encountered a hate comment online (luckily, one of the very few throughout the years). It didn’t bother me that much, but it did leave a feeling that I can’t quite make out yet. 

I guess what I truly want to share is this: whatever that you choose to do, do it with a genuine heart. 

There will always be people on the other side of the fence, doubting you and not wanting to see you succeed and/or be happy. But know that by leading your life with the most honest of intentions, you will in turn attract people who sees it, and are on the same frequency. 

When you find your people, hold them tight! Celebrate life, celebrate both wins and losses. I’m elated and grateful to be featured in this article, and have received lots of love from my friends and families 🥳 But here’s a reminder that I’m nowhere near successful! Success is relative and the definition to me, is constantly being redefined. Truth be told, I’m not a 100% certain what my end goal is but I can confidently say that the choices I make both in business and in my personal life, are ones that are truthful and sincere. I intend to uphold this in all aspects of life 🙌🏼

So go on, be unapologetically you and make good choices my nocte fam 🖤

What an unusual pairing! But I’ll have to say that this is my latest obsession 😍 

The tourmalines we typically talk about are black tourmaline so multicolored ones like these are such a breath of fresh air‼️(I’m slightly biased, my first crystal pendant gifted by my Dad is watermelon tourmaline)

Tourmalines are such a mystery. Its name derived from a Sinhalese word “turamali” which translates to “unknown gemstones of mixed colors”😨 Generally tourmalines are excellent for releasing tension and strengthening your spirit. It enhances energy flow within the body, helping to clear any blockages. A shaman stone - can be used for protection during rituals✨

76,76,2021-04-23 12:24:44,"Of all the crystals that I enjoy sourcing, I find one of the greatest joys is finding Ocean Jasper treasures like these! 

Ocean Jaspers in recent years have been highly sought after and I 100% understand why. Each and every piece is unique and you literally don’t get any 2 same pieces—only similar ones! 

But of course, beautiful and colorful pieces are getting increasingly harder to obtain since they only come from one place, the Northwest coast of Madagascar. 

One thing that I’ve learnt from OJs is to view flaws and imperfections as distinctive features that set you apart from others. There’s no intrigue in being perfect and sometimes, it’s outright boring! 

OJs come with an array of colors, patterns and often times have natural crevices and pockets. That to me, evokes an authentic sense of self. So what if they’re not smooth to the touch, so what if they have pocket holes all around, so what if they may not be everyone’s taste? They know their worth and are not afraid to show it.

Stripping away all of its known healing properties, I’d like to think the lesson to be learnt from Rainbow Fluorite is that beauty and love transcends physical appearance.

We’ve all been told to keep this crystal away from direct sunlight as its colors will fade overtime.

I recall my Dad’s personal rainbow fluorite piece which still sits in the family home. It was once colorful and striking—the reason why he purchased it some 20 years ago. 

I wasn’t sure if he had it out in the sunlight all these years, but what is left of it: a colorless transparent crystal, tinged with pale green. It is still beautiful, it is what I’ve known it to be. But now knowing it was once full of colors, makes it a little sad.

I love Rainbow Fluorite with all of its various hues from purple to green to blue and more, it makes me happy. It teaches me to cherish our time of youth. But I think I’m also ready to continue loving it, even when it loses all of its colors.",6,214

This year threw a lot of curve balls and amidst everything, we all probably learnt several things about ourselves, the people around us, the world we once lived in. We learn that change is necessary. We learn that we are stronger than we think we are.

But while we reassure ourselves to see the silver lining, let’s admit that 2020 sucked. A whole lot. And maybe moving forward, even though we always wish for the next year to be better, let’s be honest: change starts now! Not whenever you get a new journal for the new year, or when the clock strikes 12 midnight on the 31st. 

So maybe let’s work to that. Keeping it real. Here’s to 2021! I’m ready for growth and challenges to overcome. As for rewards? That’s a bonus.",58,105

Loving this new obsidian butterfly carving✨ This year, I find myself drawn to the symbolism of butterflies and moths. It brought back some childhood memories of catching butterflies by the bushes and being so fascinated by how beautiful their wings are.

SWIPE FOR GIVEAWAY 😇

To thank you for all your love & for being the light to the darkness, I will be giving away the largest labradorite star that I featured yesterday 🦋 

The Star, albeit the biggest, does not have a flash with the same vibrancy and intensity as the rest. However, what she has, is something more subtle, yet enchanting. She reminds me of how we should live in this lifetime; to see beauty in the little things, even if it may be hard to see at first. To continue being our authentic self, even if we don’t seem to shine like those around us. 

Her colors are not obvious in daylight and I had much difficulty trying to capture photos. But, with a shine of the torchlight, look at how she glows! With silvery pastel rainbows, her flashes are like no other—because she is who she is; Beautiful in her own ways ✨

One of my favorite combinations, iolite-sunstone has so much to offer. Known as the “vision” stone, it helps to widen your imagination and open your mind to endless possibilities in your life. 

Yesterday, while writing down my intentions during the new moon, I came across an article that teaches how having openness is an important key to not just setting intentions, but to all aspects of our life. 

By freeing our mind and creating a space for openness, we are inviting new knowledge, ideas, feelings, opportunities, people and more. In that space, acknowledge and feel. Even if something comes up in a negative way, breathe and acknowledge its presence- there is no right or wrong! 

This learning came at a perfect timing with the new moon in Libra. Don’t forget to set your intentions within 48 hours of the new moon ✨

Green: a restful color of nature - symbolises growth, renewal, harmony, fertility and freshness. 

I haven’t seen many touching on color magick and I wanted to share this! Intention setting can be incorporated in many ways and the more interesting one I find to be color magick. You don’t have to own fancy things or rely solely on crystals. 

Colors exist in your every day life from your choice of clothing, beauty products, foods, home decor, flowers, candles and more! 

It may not seem like much but such mundane routine can be made purposeful when done with the right intentions.

Next time you get dressed for the day, or choose what you have for lunch - get thinking! For meanings of colors, you may refer to chakra charts! ✨

I wanted to thank all of you for your overwhelming love and support yet again- but something is telling me to not only share love and light, but what is dark and unspoken of. •

When I started illa nocte (supposedly to mean “that night” in Latin, might be grammatically incorrect 😂) I wanted to be somewhat of a companion for people who are going through or have gone through dark times. The whole idea of “night” spoke to me because that is when we’re the most vulnerable. •

There’s always a preference to what is light and frilly but I do not want to forget that there is duality—what’s dark is just as important. We all have a side to us that we avoid showing or needs to be worked on but that doesn’t make us any less worthy. With this post, I encourage you to face your darker self and embrace all of your imperfections. •

Do your shadow work but never feel bad for all the facets of your self. •

Spiritual growth is all about learning and healing your inner self. While we share a mutual love for crystals, I hope you do not forget to love yourself— all of the good and the bad.

I've always been quite introspective but there are times when you are so caught up with everything thats going on, that you don't really give yourself some me-time to think through your thoughts and actions. In this industry and how the nature of crystals are (i.e. positive energies), we are always told to stay positive! Good vibes! Put forth your best self! Yes, a positive constant reminder is great. But I do not think it is realistic. Sometimes, you wake up on the wrong side of bed and am simply not your best self. Sometimes, you find it hard to love yourself, or have done things that you're not proud of. Here's what i want you to know: Do not be pressured to ""put on your best self"", but instead accept your real self. Accept that it is OKAY to have bad days and make bad decisions. We are not all made up of light, and just because you see your inner darkness, it doesn't mean you're a bad person or are in a bad place. Crystals are great, but they aren't a miracle cure for how you're feeling and what actions you will take. Only you are in control, so take charge and let's be real.

Bel 🖤",21,144

“illa nocte” was actually born in 2016 when I had the idea for a metaphysical shop right after graduating from school! However, due to life events getting in the way, things took a back seat and I went on to focus on myself first. It was time that I needed and in hindsight, while I wished I had persisted at illa nocte back then, I knew it was meant to happen this way and for good reasons. Fast forward today, this is me with a re-ignited passion to get illa nocte going! My goal is to build a community with like-minded people to share our love for crystals and jewelry. More importantly, to spread a little magic — stay magical! ✨💜 ————————————————
